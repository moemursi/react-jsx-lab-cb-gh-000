# React JSX Lab

## Overview

In this lab, you'll compile your JavaScript into JSX, defining a React component.

## Setup

We'll focus on writing JSX code to render components. Make sure you export your components; otherwise the tests won't be able to access your code! *The tests will not run until you create components and export them for each of the files below.*

## Registration fdorm
1. In the `components/RegistrationForm.js` file, create a React component called `RegistrationForm`.
2. This component should contain the following:
    - One `<form>` element
    - Two `<input>` elements — one has a `text` type, the other one is a `password`
    - One `<button>` element with the `submit` type

## FillerText
1. In the `components/FillerText.js` file, create a React component called `FillerText`.
2. This component should be a paragraph containing the following text: `I am a filler text. I can be used to fill your screen. Amazing!`

## Webpage
1. In the `components/Webpage.js` file, create a React component called `Webpage`.
2. This component should contain a title with the text `The world's coolest webpage`.
3. This component should also contain _two_ instances of the `FillerText` component.

## Note
In JSX, all tags must close. A good example of where this can cause problems is the `<input>` tag. Writing the tag like this will throw an error if you're not following it somewhere with a corresponding `</input>` tag. However, if the element has no children — that is, you don't need to put anything between the opening and closing tags — you can just use a self-closing tag like this: `<input />`.
